Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, one number per line. For each printed number, use the following rules:

if the number is divisible by 3 or contains 3, replace 3 by "Foo";
if the number is divisible by 5 or contains 5, replace 5 by "Bar";
if the number contains 7, replace by "Qix";

Example: 1 2 FooFoo 4 BarBar Foo Qix 8 Foo Bar

More details:

* divisors have high precedence, ex: 51 -> FooBar
* the content is analysed in the order they appear, ex: 53 -> BarFoo
* 13 contains 3 so we print "Foo"
* 15 is divisible by 3 and 5 and contains 5, so we print �FooBarBar�
* 33 contains 3 two times and is divisible by 3, so we print �FooFooFoo�
* 27 is divisible by 3 and contains 7, so we print "FooQix"
